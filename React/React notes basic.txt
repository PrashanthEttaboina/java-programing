-> package.json - contains dependencies and scripts required for the project
   
	if you have npm the you will get package-lock.json
   	if you have yarn you will get yarn-lock.json
   	in our case we are using npm so we get package-lock.json

-> package-lock.json - they simply ensure consistenet dependencies

folder: node_modules - in this folder all the depnedencies are installed it is created when you run 			create-react-app command or npm install

folder: public - we have the following files

-> manifest.json - is conserned with progressive web apps which is out of scope for beginners

-> favicon.ico 
-> logo192.png
-> logo512.png
   these 3 files contains logo image which you can see in the browser

-> index.html - it is the only html file you are going to have in the application.
		typically you are not going to add any code in this file. 
		maybe some changes in the head tag but not in the body tag. 
		you want react to control the ui and for that purpose we have one div tag with 		id="root" i.e <div id="root"></div> at runtime the react application takes over this 		div tag and is ultimately responsible for the ui.


Folder: src - where you will work more for developing 
-> index.js - it is the starting point for react application. in index.js we specify the root 		component which is the App component 
			<React.StrictMode>
    				<App />
  			</React.StrictMode>
		and a dom element which will be controlled by react. 
	example: element with id root -> document.getElementById('root')
	root is the element which we have specified in the index.html 
	we call this div element as the root dom node because everything inside it will be controlled 	by react

	<React.StrictMode>
    		<App />
  	</React.StrictMode>,
  	document.getElementById('root')

	the app component (<App />) is rendered inside the root dom node
	<App /> refers to the app component which is present in App.js 
	App refers to the view which is displayed in the browser 
-> App.css - file for styling 
-> App.test.js - for unit testing 
-> index.css - is for applying the styles for body tag 
-> logo.svg - which is referenced under app component
-> reportWebVitals.js - is conserned with progressive web apps which is out of scope for beginners
